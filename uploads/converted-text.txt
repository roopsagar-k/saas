A   solicitous B   munificent C   irresolute D   laconic E   fastidious F   taciturn  Questions 6 through 8   are based on the following reading passage.  Music critics have consistently defined James P. Johnson as a great early jazz pianist, originator of the 1920s Harlem “stride” style, and an important blues and jazz composer. In addition, however, Johnson was an innovator in classical music, composing  5   symphonic music that incorporated American, and especially African American, traditions. Such a blend of musical elements was not entirely new: by 1924 both Milhaud and Gershwin had composed classical works that incorporated elements of jazz. Johnson, a serious musician  10   more experienced than most classical composers with jazz, blues, spirituals, and popular music, was particularly suited to expand Milhaud’s and Gershwin’s experiments. In 1927 he completed his first large-scale work, the blues- and jazz-inspired Yamekraw, which included borrowings from spirituals and Johnson’s own  15   popular songs. Yamekraw, premiered successfully in Carnegie Hall, was a major achievement for Johnson, becoming his most frequently performed extended work. It demonstrated vividly the possibility of assimilating contemporary popular music into the symphonic tradition.  Line ets.org/gre 4 Download facility provided by6.   Select and indicate the best answer from among the five answer choices: The passage states that Johnson composed all of the following EXCEPT A   jazz works B   popular songs C   symphonic music D   spirituals E   blues pieces 7.

They made few attempts to introduce innovations into the classical symphonic tradition. 8.

(A word is boldfaced and underlined for reference in answering question 10.)  Scholarship on political newspapers and their editors is dominated by the view that as the United States grew, the increasing influence of the press led, ultimately, to the neutral reporting from which we benefit today. Pasley considers this view oversimplified,  5   because neutrality was not a goal of early national newspaper editing, even when editors   disingenuously   stated that they aimed to tell all sides of a story. Rather, the intensely partisan ideologies represented in newspapers of the early republic led to a clear demarcation between traditional and republican values. The editors  10   responsible for the papers’ content—especially those with republican agendas—began to see themselves as central figures in the development of political consciousness in the United States.  Line  9.   Consider   each   of the three choices separately and select   all   that apply. The passage suggests that Pasley would agree with which of the following statements about the political role of newspapers? A   Newspapers today are in many cases much less neutral in their political reporting than is commonly held by scholars. B   Newspapers in the early United States normally declared quite openly their refusal to tell all sides of most political stories. C   The editorial policies of some early United States newspapers became a counterweight to proponents of traditional values. ets.org/gre 6 Download facility provided by10.

(A sentence is boldfaced and underlined for reference in answering question 16.)  In Raisin in the Sun,   Lorraine Hansberry does not reject integration or the economic and moral promise of the American dream; rather, she remains loyal to this dream while looking, realistically, at its incomplete realization. Once we recognize this  5   dual vision, we can accept the play’s ironic nuances as deliberate social commentaries by Hansberry rather than as the “unintentional” irony that Bigsby attributes to the work.   Indeed, a curiously persistent refusal to credit Hansberry with a capacity for intentional irony has led some critics to interpret the play’s  10   thematic conflicts as mere confusion, contradiction, or eclecticism . Isaacs, for example, cannot easily reconcile Hansberry’s intense concern for her race with her ideal of human reconciliation. But the play’s complex view of Black self-esteem and human solidarity as compatible is no more “contradictory” than  15   Du Bois’s famous, well-considered ideal of ethnic self-awareness coexisting with human unity, or Fanon’s emphasis on an ideal internationalism that also accommodates national identities and roles.

Select and indicate the best answer from among the five answer choices: The author of the passage would probably consider which of the following judgments to be most similar to the reasoning of the critics described in the underlined and boldfaced sentence (lines 7-11) ? A   The world is certainly flat; therefore, the person proposing to sail around it is unquestionably foolhardy. B   Radioactivity cannot be directly perceived; therefore, a scientist could not possibly control it in a laboratory. C   The painter of this picture could not intend it to be funny; therefore, its humor must result from a lack of skill. D   Traditional social mores are beneficial to culture; therefore, anyone who deviates from them acts destructively. E   Filmmakers who produce documentaries deal exclusively with facts; therefore, a filmmaker who reinterprets particular events is misleading us. 17.

Question 18   is based on the following text.  As an example of the devastation wrought on music publishers by the photocopier, one executive noted that for a recent choral festival with 1,200 singers, the festival’s organizing committee purchased only 12 copies of the music published by her company that was  5   performed as part of the festival.

A   Only a third of the 1,200 singers were involved in performing the music published by the executive’s company. B   Half of the singers at the festival had already heard the music they were to perform before they began to practice for the festival. C   Because of shortages in funding, the organizing committee of the choral festival required singers to purchase their own copies of the music performed at the festival. D   Each copy of music that was performed at the festival was shared by two singers. E   As a result of publicity generated by its performance at the festival, the type of music performed at the festival became more widely known.

A tall tree can transport a hundred gallons of water a day from its roots deep underground to the treetop. Is this movement propelled by pulling the water from above or pushing it from below? The pull mechanism has long been favored by most scientists. First proposed  5   in the late 1800s, the theory relies on a property of water not commonly associated with fluids: its tensile strength. Instead of making a clean break, water evaporating from treetops tugs on the remaining water molecules, with that tug extending from molecule to molecule all the way down to the roots. The tree itself does not  10   actually push or pull; all the energy for lifting water comes from the sun’s evaporative power. 23.
