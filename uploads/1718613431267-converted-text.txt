JEE (Advanced) 2023   Paper 1 1/10  SECTION 1 (Maximum Marks: 12)     This section contains   THREE (03)   questions.     Each question has   FOUR   options (A), (B), (C) and (D).   ONE OR MORE THAN ONE   of these four option(s) is(are) correct answer(s).     For each question, choose the option(s) corresponding to (all) the correct answer(s).     Answer to each question will be evaluated according to the following marking scheme:  Full Marks   :   ൅4   ONLY   if (all) the correct option(s) is(are) chosen;  Partial Marks   :   ൅3   If all the four options are correct but   ONLY   three options are chosen;  Partial Marks   :   ൅2   If three or more options are correct but   ONLY   two options are chosen, both of which are correct;  Partial Marks   :   ൅1   If two or more options are correct but   ONLY   one option is chosen and it is a correct option;  Zero Marks   :   0 If none of the options is chosen (i.e. the question is unanswered);  Negative Marks   :   െ2   In all other cases.     For example, in a question, if (A), (B) and (D) are the ONLY three options corresponding to correct answers, then choosing ONLY (A), (B) and (D) will get   ൅4   marks; choosing ONLY (A) and (B) will get   ൅2   marks; choosing ONLY (A) and (D) will get   ൅2   marks; choosing ONLY (B) and (D) will get   ൅2   marks; choosing ONLY (A) will get +1 mark; choosing ONLY (B) will get +1 mark; choosing ONLY (D) will get +1 mark; choosing no option (i.e. the question is unanswered) will get 0 marks; and choosing any other combination of options will get   െ2   marks.
